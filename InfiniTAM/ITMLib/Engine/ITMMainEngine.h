    overview additional documentation can be found in the included Technical
    Report.

    point to the library.

		/** \brief
		    Main engine, that instantiates all the other engines and
		    provides a simplified interface to them.

		    This class is the main entry point to the ITMLib library
		    and basically performs the whole KinectFusion algorithm.
		    It stores the latest image internally, as well as the 3D
		    world model and additionally it keeps track of the camera
		    pose.

		    The intended use is as follows:
		    -# Create an ITMMainEngine specifying the internal settings,
		       camera parameters and image sizes
		    -# Get the pointer to the internally stored images with
		       @ref GetView() and write new image information to that
		       memory
		    -# Call the method @ref ProcessFrame() to track the camera
		       and integrate the new information into the world model
		    -# Optionally access the rendered reconstruction or another
		       image for visualisation using @ref GetImage()
		    -# Iterate the above three steps for each image in the
		       sequence

		    To access the internal information, look at the member
		    variables @ref trackingState and @ref scene.
